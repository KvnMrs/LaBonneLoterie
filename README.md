# LeBonLot

## Speetch

The purpose of this web site is to offer a service where the seller can publish ads for these everyday items (clothing, multimedia, sport...).
Instead of selling the item at a fixed price, the sale takes the form of a lottery ticket.
The seller decides on a number of available tickets, a unit price, and a draw date.
The buyer can buy tickets and take part in the lottery draw at the end of the timer.
